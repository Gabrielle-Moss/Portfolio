    <h1><b>About me</b></h1>
        <p> I am a recently graduate from Kingston University (2014-17), where I studied Physical Geography and graduated with a 2:1. I’m currently furthering my expertise in the field of Geographical Information Systems, studying for an MSc in GIS at The University of Leeds. </p>

<p>My interest for geography truly began within the Lake District in Cumbria, where I spent much of my childhood. The love of the outdoors and nature was born by hiking, kayaking and swimming in the national park here, a time in my life I would never alter. </p>
<img src="Windermere (1).jpg" alt="Windermere" width="400" height="277"> <img src="LakeDistrictSwim.jpg" alt="Black Moss Pot" width="400" height="277">

<p>Through my adolescence and time at university, I have gained and continued a passion for multiple sporting activities. My focus through most of life was my swimming, a focus that resulted in me gaining a NPLQ Lifeguarding and a Health and Safety in the Workplace certificates in 2013, resulting in myself working as a lifeguard throughout my undergrad. The love of swimming also led me into swimming multiple Swimmathon’s with my sister and mother in 2014 and 2015 in Brockwell lido, both resulting in gaining £200 for Cancer Research.</p>
<p>My University time also allowed me to pursue new hobbies such as joining the Kingston University Woman’s Rugby Club (KUWR), where I spent two years. The wonderful team I joined helped expand my social circle with the wonderful team, and allowed myself to relieve the stress of university work onto the pitch. In my first year at Kingston I also dabbled into the film society and triathlon team, but this was a shorter lived passion.</p>

  <p><u>Personal Description</u></p>
  <p> 
I am a confident hard-working individual or team member. I have good communication skills, and am people-centred. I fit into 
teams, but take responsibility for personal and team achievement. I’m flexible, and learn quickly, with good general computer skills, 
and have done troubleshooting and support for users in a library, and worked in a high-pressure university clearing house contact centre. 
I have carried out resource mapping work for a small energy development business, and work experience at Lightsource plc, the largest UK
 solar developer.
</p>
 
 <p>
I am a recent Geography graduate, with an emphasis on physical geography. My undergraduate thesis was a GIS-based project on coastal erosion, 
modelling the loss of shoreline over time using ArcGIS. I am currently studying for an MSc in Geographical Information Systems at The 
University of Leeds. I have also completed a BTEC in Business Studies prior to my University studies.
</p>

<p>
I’m interested in applying technology to understand and manage both the built and natural environment, and my current studies are providing 
the technical tools and framework to enable this. I’m keen to apply my skills on behalf of an organisation providing services and management 
expertise to its clients.

<p><u><a href="https://gabrielle-moss.github.io/Extras/Dissertation.pdf">Undergrad Dissertation: Assessment of Changes in the Historical Shoreline of the South Walney Island, Cumbria</a></u><br>
The final piece of my undergraduate puzzle was to produce a 10,000 word dissertation, worth 25% of my degree, given the final grade of a 2:1. 
My chosen subject was to assess the coastal erosion of Walney Island, Cumbria over several hundred years. This was done by comparing six different 
Ordinance Survey dating from 1849 to 1989 and two LANDSAT images collected from Google Earth. This statistical analysis of the project was conducted 
by using the USGS DSAS toolbar, an extension using ArcGIS.

<p><u><a href="https://github.com/Gabrielle-Moss/gy17gjm">Agent-Based Model Project</a></u><br>
As part as my 'Programming for Geographical Information Analysis' module within my MSc at Leeds, I set the task of producing my own agent-based model using data provided through the course. 
The aim of the final peice was to build agents using the provided data, which interacted with a restricted environment 'eating' data it encountered, storing this data and sharing it with its neighboroughs. All contained within a GUI.
